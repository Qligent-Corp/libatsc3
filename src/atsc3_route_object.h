  	 A/331/2020 A3.10.2:
	 	 The ROUTE receiver allocates a Boolean array RECEIVED[0..T-1] or RECEIVED[0..Tâ€™-1], as appropriate, with all entries initialized to false to track
	 	 received object symbols.

	 jjustman: instead, we will keep a collection of our LCT packet headers, for the following use cases:

	  1.) for any sparse gaps for NRT recovery with carousel
	  2.) raptorQ SBN+ESI for recovery packet collection
	  3.) incomplete tracking of ROUTE/DASH media fragments
	  4.) purging of t-30s ROUTE/DASH media fragements for local on-disk cache management


	 The ROUTE receiver continuously acquires packet payloads for the object as long as all of the following conditions are satisfied:

		i) there is at least one entry in RECEIVED still set to false;
		ii) the object has not yet expired; and
		iii) the application has not given up on reception of this object. More details are provided below.
